Adventure Core Text Adventure System
====================================

# Overview #

Adventure Core (this is probably not a final title, yes it's a Portal 2 joke,
yes I'm aware it's probably been done before) is a portable text adventure
engine and a game I'm writing for it. It is going to be implemented in python.
I'm doing this entirely for fun. Feel free to let me know what you think!

Not yet at anything I'd even come close to calling a version
