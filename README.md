Adventure Core Text Adventure System
====================================

# Overview #

Adventure Core (this is probably not a final title, yes it's a Portal 2 joke,
yes I'm aware it's probably been done before) is a portable text adventure
engine and a game I'm writing for it. It is going to be implemented in python.
I'm doing this entirely for fun. Feel free to let me know what you think!
